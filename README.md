# Boston_Spectrum_Website
A repo for all the code and supporting documents used to create the new Boston Spectrum Website.

The repository will be broken into two main folders: Documents and Code.
If it is part of the website itself, it will go in the Code folder.
If it is NOT part of the website, it should go in Documents.
