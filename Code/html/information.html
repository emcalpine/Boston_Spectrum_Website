			<h2>Specs and Common Uses:</h2>
				<p>The Boston Spectrum is a large modern building with approximately 3000 square feet of open space.
This hall can accommodate about 400 guests comfortably but has held more for large events. We use this hall for our fund raising efforts. The majority of the proceeds from rentals are used for maintenance of this hall and of course payment of utilities. The remainder is used to fund the Greenock Volunteer Fire Company in the purchase and maintenance of equipment in order to provide Fire and Emergency services to Greenock, all of Elizabeth Township and surrounding municipalities. We will accept all criticism whether it is negative, positive or constructive in order to provide you the renter with the best experience possible for and during your event.
We understand the importance of having a first rate facility that is able to meet your needs at the time of your rental. We will do all that we can to make that happen.
We can set up the hall any way that you may require for your event including but not limited to:
